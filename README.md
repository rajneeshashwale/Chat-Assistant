# Chat-AssistantThis HTML/CSS/JS Chat Assistant provides a modern, minimal chat experience that’s ideal for demos, prototypes, or embedding into existing web projects.

Key highlights include:

Responsive, mobile-first layout with CSS that’s easy to override.

Message bubbles for user & assistant, timestamping and smooth auto-scroll on new messages.

Modular JavaScript functions to handle input, send/receive messages, and hook into any AI or server endpoint.

Lightweight and dependency-free — no frameworks required.

Easy to extend: add image upload, typing indicators, persistent chat history (localStorage), or voice input with a few lines of JS.

Built for developers who want a clean starting point: drop the HTML into your page, tweak the CSS, and wire the JS to your API key or server logic.
